Cloning a git repository 
1.git clone repo name 
2.repo name might be ssh file or http file

1.If you want a git repo as it is in use .(period) after the command 
2.If you want a folder and inside that you have all the repo then dont use .(period)after the command.

Initializing the new git repository:
git init (This will initialize the repository we are  working in )

Put all the files inside the folder into staging area 
git add --a

create a repository only with the help of git command line 
curl -u "omkar-xx-x" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"RepoCreatedUsingGit" , "private":"false"}'


When we have commit a change into github account using git you can make use of following code(Only if you are doing for the first time)
git remote set-url origin https://username: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@github.com/omkar-xx-x/Git-Learning-Flairminds.git

 git remote add origin <url>
 When you use command 'git remote add origin <url>' , you are establishing a connection between your local git repository and remote repository hoisted on platform like Github

 To verify connection we can make use of the git remove -v command 

 To check on which branch we are we use 
 git branch

 To rename the branch to another name we can do it using following way..
 git branch -M main(main here is the new name of the branch)

 git use origin main :
 Since , this command is too lengthy , we might need to use it again and again , rather we can use
    git push -u origin main 
 This way you are using above command for the first time and later you only need to use git push 

Branch commands : 
git branch (To check branch we are in) 

git branch -M(to rename branch)

git checkout<branch-name> (to-navigate)
Suppose we are in main branch and we want to go to featureOne branch we can use 
git checkout featureOne

To create a new branch we can use following command 
git checkout -b featureOne 
Above command will create a new branch with name featureOne

git branch -d featureOne 
We must go to another branch before deleting the branch we want to delete
